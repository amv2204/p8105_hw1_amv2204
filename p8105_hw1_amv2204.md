# Problem 1:

After installing the package with the penguin dataset, we will load it:

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

After selecting the *penguins* dataset from the environment pane, we can
visually inspect it in the console. This dataset has contains
information about different species of penguins. The variables included
provide information about each penguinâ€™s *species, island, bill length,
bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and the year*.

This dataset has 344 rows, which we found by using the code
`nrow(penguins)` and 8 columns, found using code `ncol(penguins)`.

To find the mean flipper length, we will first load the tidyverse
package `library(tidyverse)` to be able to use the `pull` function to
find the mean.

Using the code
`mean(pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)` we get the
mean flipper length of **200.9152**.

We will now load the `ggplot2` package and make a scatter plot with
`bill_length_mm` as the *x* variable and `flipper_length_mm` as the *y*
variable. We will also add color to distinguish the different `species`.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Now we will export this plot to the directory.

``` r
ggsave("First_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 4)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_hw1_amv2204_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
