# Problem 1:

After installing the package with the penguin dataset, we will load it:

```{r beginning}
library(palmerpenguins)

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
After selecting the _penguins_ dataset from the environment pane, we can visually inspect it in the console. This dataset has contains information about different species of penguins. The variables included provide information about each penguin's _species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and the year_.

This dataset has 344 rows, which we found by using the code `nrow(penguins)` and 8 columns, found using code `ncol(penguins)`.

To find the mean flipper length, we will first load the tidyverse package `library(tidyverse)` to be able to use the `pull` function to find the mean.

Using the code `mean(pull(penguins, var = flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)` we get the mean flipper length of **200.9152**.  


We will now load the `ggplot2` package and make a scatter plot with `bill_length_mm` as the _x_ variable and `flipper_length_mm` as the _y_ variable. We will also add color to distinguish the different `species`. 

```{r second_block}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

Now we will export this plot to the directory.

```{r third_block}
ggsave("First_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 4)
```















```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
